# BizManage Pro Documentation

## Overview

**BizManage Pro** is a comprehensive business management solution designed to help business owners, managers, staff, suppliers, and customers operate more efficiently. It provides a centralized system for managing operations, stock, employees, financial insights, and customer interactions while incorporating predictive analytics and real-time updates.

Each business created within the system is assigned a unique **Business ID**, generated upon creation by the Owner. This Business ID is used by Owners, Managers, Staff, and Cashiers to log in and access their specific business dashboard through the web application home page. Suppliers and Customers interact via our public API and do not require a Business ID to access supplier or customer portals.

This document outlines the features, architecture, and implementation plan for BizManage Pro.

1. **Users**:

   * `id`, `name`, `email`, `role`, `branch_id`, `permissions`
2. **Businesses**:

   * `business_id`, `name`, `owner_id`, `created_at`
3. **Branches**:

   * `branch_id`, `business_id`, `manager_id`, `location`
4. **Products**:

   * `product_id`, `name`, `price`, `stock_level`, `expiry_date`
5. **Transactions**:

   * `transaction_id`, `branch_id`, `cashier_id`, `total_amount`, `date`
6. **Suppliers**:

   * `supplier_id`, `name`, `products_supplied`
7. **Customers**:

   * `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `preferred_products`

## Backend Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication and Role Management

1. **Setup Firebase for Authentication**:

   * Role-based access control (Owner, Manager, Staff, Cashier, Supplier, Customer).
   * Multi-factor authentication.
   * Session management.

2. **Business ID Generation & Home Page Login**:

   * When an Owner creates a new business, the system generates a unique **Business ID**.
   * Business ID is provided to the Owner for secure distribution to Managers, Staff, and Cashiers.
   * Web application home page allows users to enter their Business ID and credentials to access their business dashboard.
   * Suppliers and Customers use public login endpoints (`/supplier/login`, `/customer/login`) without Business ID.

3. **Create Flask Authentication API**:

   * Endpoints for login, registration, and role assignment:

     * `/auth/register`: Registers a user under a specific Business ID (except suppliers/customers).
     * `/auth/login`: Logs in users by validating Business ID, email, and password.
     * `/supplier/login`: Supplier portal login without Business ID.
     * `/customer/login`: Customer portal login without Business ID.
   * JWT token implementation with Business ID claim.
   * Password hashing and security.

### Phase 2: Core API Development

1. **Business Management**:

   * Endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting businesses.
   * Assign branches to managers.
2. **Product and Stock Management**:

   * CRUD operations for products.
   * Real-time stock updates.
3. **Employee Management**:

   * Track working hours and performance logs.

### Phase 3: Analytics and AI Integration

1. **Predictive Models**:

   * AI-driven stock predictions based on historical data.
   * Financial forecasts using machine learning models.
2. **Recommendation System**:

   * Personalized product recommendations for customers and suppliers.

### Phase 4: Testing and Debugging

* Role-based testing for all endpoints.
* End-to-end testing for core workflows (e.g., creating a business, assigning roles, generating reports).

### Phase 5: Deployment

1. **Containerization with Docker**:

   * Ensure consistency across environments.
2. **Hosting**:

   * Use AWS or Google Cloud for scalable hosting.
