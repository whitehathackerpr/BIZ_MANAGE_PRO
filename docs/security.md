# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the BIZ_MANAGE_PRO application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens are available for extended sessions
- Tokens are signed with a secure secret key
- Tokens include user ID and role information

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Minimum password length: 12 characters
- Password complexity requirements:
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Hierarchical role system:
  - Super Admin
  - Branch Manager
  - Staff Member
  - Cashier
- Fine-grained permissions per role
- Branch-specific access control

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- 100 requests per minute for authenticated users
- 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated users
- IP-based rate limiting
- Rate limit headers included in responses

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through content escaping
- CSRF protection with tokens

### API Authentication
- JWT tokens required for all API endpoints
- Token validation on every request
- Token refresh mechanism
- Secure token storage

## Data Security

### Database Security
- Encrypted database connections
- Regular security updates
- Principle of least privilege for database users
- Prepared statements for all queries

### Data Encryption
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Key rotation policies
- Secure key storage

### Backup Security
- Encrypted backups
- Secure backup storage
- Regular backup testing
- Access control for backups

## Network Security

### HTTPS
- SSL/TLS required for all connections
- HSTS enabled
- Secure cipher suites
- Regular certificate renewal

### Firewall Rules
- Minimal open ports
- IP whitelisting for admin access
- DDoS protection
- Regular security audits

## Application Security

### Code Security
